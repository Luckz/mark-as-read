# Mark as Read

Imagine every website was an item in a todo list. This extension allows you to tick those items off.

Born out of my own need to keep track of appartment listings when looking to rent a house. 

## How to Install

Get the extension [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mark-as-read/hiflhkmicfagennabmnfcnnlpkmidfjj):

## How to Use

Notice the new icon on the Chrome toolbar. 

![Image of checked page](https://github.com/edoreld/mark-as-read/blob/master/markasread/icon_128.png?raw=true)

When you go to a page you haven't ticked off, the item will look like the following:

![Image of unchecked page](https://github.com/edoreld/mark-as-read/blob/master/markasread/notvisited.png?raw=true)

If you click on the extension icon, it will change from unchecked to checked or viceversa.

That's all.
