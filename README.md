# Mark as Read

Imagine every website was an item in a todo list. This extension allows you to tick those items off.

Born out of my own need to keep track of appartment listings when looking to rent a house. 

## How to Install

Grab the latest release from the releases page, unzip it and then follow these instructions<sup>[[1]]</sup>:

1. Visit chrome://extensions 
2. Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
3. Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
4. Select the directory you just unzipped. 

 -> The extension will not work as intended if two windows are open side by side.

## How to Use

Notice the new icon on the Chrome toolbar.

When you go to a page you haven't ticked off, the item will look like the following:

![Image of unchecked page](https://github.com/edoreld/mark-as-read/blob/master/markasread/notvisited.png?raw=true)

If you click on the extension icon, it will change from unchecked to checked or viceversa.

That's all.
